# Meetings notes

## Midterm meeting

- **DATE:** 15.4.2019 16.40-17.10
- **ASSISTANTS:**
- **GRADE:** _To be filled by course staff_

### Minutes

The documentation was still under work, but REST api and database was already working. Also testing was done by only
Postman, which was not a proper way to test. The project was chosen to be done by NodeJS and MongoDB, which was quite
risky because course material was with Python and SQL-database. But this desicion was made due to student having
_some_ experience from javascript and own interes towards that language.

### Action points

To fill the documentation, including HAL profile.
Answers-collection was not needed --> Removed.
HAL-FORMS was recommended to provide also template in response.
/answers/{id} to be added
testing must be done with code!
Bootstrap can be used for client.
